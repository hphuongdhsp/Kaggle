# Kaggle Santa

This repositories include all of codes in the Santa Competition. 

This competition is just a hunting leak problem, that means you can find directly some the targets of test set directly from infomation of train set. 
My code include 2 similar models, lgbm and xgboost. It easy to get 1.37 in LP without leak. After that I blending 2 solutions  without leak and fill the leakly columns. With the simple code, I get 0.51 in LB and got silve.
